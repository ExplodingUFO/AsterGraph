# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** Hosts can integrate only the graph-editor pieces they need, replace default UI and behavior seams safely, and keep building on a stable public API instead of patching internal implementation details.
**Current focus:** Define the next milestone on top of the shipped v1.2 kernel-first runtime, descriptor contracts, and readiness proof ring

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone Planning
Plan: None
Status: Ready For New Milestone
Last activity: 2026-04-08 — Archived milestone v1.2 and reset the planning baseline for the next milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Carry-forward decisions from shipped milestones:

- Keep the four-package SDK boundary (`AsterGraph.Abstractions`, `AsterGraph.Core`, `AsterGraph.Editor`, `AsterGraph.Avalonia`) as the supported publish surface.
- Keep `CreateSession(...)` and `Create(...)` as the canonical composition routes, while `GraphEditorViewModel` / `GraphEditorView` remain the retained compatibility window.
- Prefer descriptor and snapshot control-plane contracts over exposing MVVM implementation types as the canonical host surface.
- Keep Avalonia as an adapter layer over shared runtime contracts and proof-backed platform seams.
- Preserve `HostSample`, `PackageSmoke`, and `ScaleSmoke` as the runnable proof ring for migration, readiness, and future extension work.

### Pending Todos

None captured yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No active blocker in the main workspace.
- The known `STATE_HISTORY_OK` mismatch remains a pre-existing baseline issue if the next milestone touches history/save semantics.
- The next milestone should avoid reopening kernel/facade ownership drift unless new evidence requires it.
